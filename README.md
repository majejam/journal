## Remarks 
Hello, I know that I'm a bit outside of the scope of this homework. You asked for a portfolio, I gave you a personnal blog. That's because I already made two portfolio and to be quite honest, this subject didn't really interrested me, so instead I did a personnal blog since I wanted to have one anyway. 
There's also no bootstrap or framework, it was supposed to be for the backoffice but I was too short and didn't have time to make one yet, I'll be sure to use a framework once I've got the time.

## Installation  
> Import the database with phpmyadmin on a localserver
> Be sure to change the settings of the database (./app/settings.php)

## Notes
There's smooth transition between pages made natively
The articles are written by hand and not by monkeys
